## EventNest – Backend

EventNest Backend is the core system powering the EventNest platform. It provides secure, scalable RESTful APIs for event creation, participant registration, QR-based attendance verification, automated email notifications, and real-time analytics.

This backend is designed to operate reliably under high load during live college events while minimizing manual administrative effort.

## Why This Backend Exists

Traditional college event systems rely heavily on manual processes, leading to delays, errors, and poor participant experience.

This backend was built to:
- Automate event workflows end-to-end
- Eliminate manual attendance verification
- Provide administrators with real-time operational insight
- Scale reliably during peak event traffic

## Engineering Focus

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- QR code–based attendance verification
- Automated email workflows using Nodemailer
- Real-time analytics and participant tracking
- Schema-driven MongoDB data modeling
- Middleware-based authorization and validation

---

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **Email Service:** Nodemailer
- **Data Visualization Support:** Chart.js (via APIs)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Core Features

- Secure role-based authentication (Student / Admin)
- Event creation and management APIs
- Participant registration and tracking
- QR code validation during check-in
- Automated email notifications for registrations and updates
- Real-time analytics endpoints for admin dashboards

---

## Architecture Overview

- Express.js handles routing, middleware, and access control
- MongoDB stores users, events, and registrations
- QR codes are generated on registration and validated at check-in
- Aggregation pipelines support real-time dashboard metrics
- RESTful APIs ensure predictable and maintainable integrations

---

## API Design Principles

- Clear separation of concerns (routes, controllers, models)
- Middleware-driven authorization and validation
- Consistent error handling and HTTP status codes
- Defensive data validation at schema and request levels
