## EventNest – College Event Management System
EventNest is a role-based college event management platform designed to simplify event creation, registration, and participation tracking for both students and administrators.
The system focuses on automation, real-time visibility, and reducing manual effort in managing large-scale college events.

## Why this project matters
College events often rely on manual coordination, paper-based check-ins, and fragmented communication, which leads to inefficiency and poor participant experience.
EventNest was created to streamline the entire event lifecycle from registration to check-in while providing administrators with real-time insights and reliable communication tools. The goal was to build a system that is scalable, transparent, and easy to manage even during high-traffic events.

## Engineering Focus
This project emphasizes real-world system efficiency and automation. Key learnings include role-based access control, QR-code–based verification, automated email workflows, and real-time data visualization.
Special attention was given to reducing manual verification, ensuring reliable email delivery, and designing admin dashboards that provide actionable insights during live events.

## Key Features
- Role-based access for students and administrators

- Event creation and participant registration

- QR code–based check-in system to verify attendees quickly

- Automated email notifications for registrations and updates
